- when changing clapi.c, performing 'make' on clapitest rebuilds libclapi, but doesn't relink the clapitest executable
    . only when SHOW_INFO is non-empty

- babs: make showgoal
    . shows full path to goal
    . does this exist already in some form?
    . '$(make showgoal) arg1 arg2 ...' tests the program

- create repo on github from command line:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2423777/is-it-possible-to-create-a-remote-repo-on-github-from-the-cli-without-ssh

    curl -u 'USER' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d '{"name":"REPO", "private":"true"}'

    . make variant of gtinit (gthinit ?)
        . same as gtinit, but no folder as a remote
        . instead, creates a gh repo from command line
            - will ask pw interactively
            - gh username in gtvars
        . the latter gh repo will be the remote
        . just use gtcommit as before

- 'run' target: perform run command defined in module.mk (complete with cl args)

curl -u bergoid https://api.github.com/user/repos -d "{\"name\": \"mytest\", \"description\": \"Description goes here\", \"private\": false, \"has_issues\": true, \"has_downloads\": true, \"has_wiki\": false}"

mkcd mytest
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/bergoid/mytest.git

echo "a test" > test.txt

gtcommit
