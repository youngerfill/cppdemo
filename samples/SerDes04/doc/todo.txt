- array/map MUST indicate size in head, but taking this into account while reading is not mandatory 
    -> will depend on container implementation, e.g. : vector pre-allocates space, 
        while list grows as entries are added.

- While reading: exact name of LH side of assignment to element/key/value must be ignored
